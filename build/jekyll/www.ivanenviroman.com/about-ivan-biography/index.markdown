My dream is of a healthy (and happy!) environment for people and the planet. My mission is to help other sustainable entrepreneurs and organizations achieve that dream. My focus is helping ecopreneurs and non-profits with web technology.





Born to US citizens in Madrid, raised in New York, London and Boston. I moved west to Boulder, Colorado soon after graduating with a B.A. in Environmental Geography at [Colgate](http://colgate.edu/). I received my MBA from the [Leeds School of Business](http://leeds.colorado.edu/) there. I experienced life at angel and VC funded start-ups in Boulder, including software business practice leader [Rational Software](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/). I started [SustainableMarketing.com](http://www.sustainablemarketing.com/) which was the first [green marketing](http://www.sustainablemarketing.com/) blog. After ten years in Boulder, I moved to San Francisco. I founded [SustainableWebsites.com](http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/) which is one of the first [green web hosting](http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/) companies, and my current company. I had a brief stay in London again in 2008, back to SF, and then in 2010 to Seattle where I have settled down (for now, the kid is helping with that!)   






I have been programming since 3rd grade, and continue to code to this day. Thatâ€™s over 20 years of professional experience since I graduated from high school and entered the workforce. My current preferred web site platform is [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and I also work with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). I use an [Agile](http://www.objectmentor.com/omSolutions/agile_why.html) development methodology, utilizing practices like Test-Driven Development ([TDD](http://geekswithblogs.net/thomasweller/archive/2009/11/03/tdd-is-not-about-testing-its-about-how-we-develop.aspx)) and Behavior-Driven Development ([BDD](http://cukes.info/)).
