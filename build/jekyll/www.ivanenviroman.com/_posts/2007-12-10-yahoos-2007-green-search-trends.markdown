New terms like "freecycle" (a Network to promote waste reduction) popped up this year, while "carbon footprint" and "carbon credits" reached a growing impression as part of the green vernacular. 2007 also saw queries on global warming reach their highest level ever â€” throughout the summer, buzz on "stop global warming" boomed, as conscientious citizens looked to reduce their carbon footprint.





More eco-friendly searches arose surrounding "pollution", and peopleused Yahoo! Search to monitor what the "Environmental Protection Agency" was doing about these issues. "Hybrid cars", "solar energy", and "recycling" topics also proved popular for those seeking a more environmentally friendly lifestyle.
