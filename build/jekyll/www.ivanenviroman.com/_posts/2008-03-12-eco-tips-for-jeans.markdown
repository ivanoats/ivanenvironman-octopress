From our friends at [UNEP sustainable consumption](http://www.uneptie.org/pc/sustain/) -- simple tips for energy efficiency and "danser le [Tecktonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecktonik)" Today, many in the fashion sector are concerned by their impacts on the environment, due to the exploitation of raw materials, the production, the transport and the generation of waste. However, the life cycle analysis of a pair of jeans shows that the main environmental impact occurs during its use phase. Therefore, the number of times jeans are worn before being washed, the washing temperature, the use of detergents, the machine-drying and the ironing constitute many crucial steps. We also shouldn't forget that a well maintained garment will last longer, thus generating less waste! And if you bought, [organic jeans](http://www.delforte.com), you would be reducing pesticide usage too.
