Ready to learn  Rails? Unlike most  Rails books,   Learning  Rails is for web developers, and not for programmers. You'll start from the foundations of the  Web you already know, and learn how to create something visible with  Rails before reaching the more difficult database models and controller code. Learning  Rails 3 covers the most recent developments.
