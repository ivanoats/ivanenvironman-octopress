#### [Joel Makower: Two Steps Forward: The Six Sins of Greenwashing](http://makower.typepad.com/joel_makower/2007/11/the-six-sins-of.html)

[![Joel Makower: Two Steps Forward: The Six Sins of Greenwashing](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/xemibap/thumbnail/160)](http://makower.typepad.com/joel_makower/2007/11/the-six-sins-of.html)

Is green marketing just a series of lies?

That's one conclusion to be drawn from a new study that examines hundreds of environmental labeling claims and found pretty much all of them wanting, suffering from sins of either omission or commission.

Is it any wonder that consumers are overwhelmingly wary of green marketing and view it as "just a sales tactic"?

ast Wednesday, November 14, was a big day for Eurostar. Not only did it open its St Pancras International terminus, it also made all Eurostar journeys carbon neutral at no extra cost to its passengers. Both Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace - who can spot the merest splash of greenwash - have applauded Eurostar for the eco-friendly changes it has made throughout its business, as well as for how it is communicating them.
