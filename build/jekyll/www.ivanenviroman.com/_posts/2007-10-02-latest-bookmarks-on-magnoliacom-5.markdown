#### [Small Business School, Inc. - The only television show in history about how to start, run and grow a business as seen on PBS and now the New York Times.](http://www.smallbusinessschool.org/)

[![Small Business School, Inc. - The only television show in history about how to start, run and grow a business as seen on PBS and now the New York Times.](http://scst.srv.girafa.com/srv/i?i=sc010159&r=smallbusinessschool.org&s=f68a546700a6cc79)](http://www.smallbusinessschool.org/)

Business is about creating something of value.
Too much of television and the cinema encourage exploitive thinking.
Too little of it explores creativity, insightful thinking, integrity, and courage.
The #1 export from the USA is our movies, games, and television shows. We need to be exporting the genius of the USA and not the stuff that pulls us down to the lowest common denominator. We should be exporting entrepreneurial education and, at the very least, those sopranos who create musical harmonies not HBO's Sopranos who thrash values and make a mockery of small business. By lifting up exploitive behavior as an art form, cleverly shaping every second, HBO and so much of commercial television and our cinema, encourage the bad, confuse the weak and the marginal, and weaken the strong.

Another bubble possibility is green, or alternative energy, shares. All the talk of global warming, allied to the high level of the oil price, is making this area very fashionable.

In Britain, the Financial Services Authority has warned that too many fund-management companies may be jumping on the bandwagon by launching environmental funds. Lipper estimates that European investors put £4.6 billion into the sector in the first seven months of this year compared with £3.1 billion in the whole of 2006.
