The NYTimes.com had a fantastic article this weekend on [The Rise of the Fleet-Footed Start-Up](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/business/25unboxed.html).  Here at [Highgroove](http://highgroove.com), we have been preaching about being lean, building products agilely, and doing more with less for quite some time.  It’s great to see a piece in the NYTimes.com Business section advocating this now-proven successful model.

...the lean playbook advises quick development of a “minimum viable product,” designed with the smallest set of features that will please some group of customers. Then, the start-up should continually experiment by tweaking its offering, seeing how the market responds and changing the product accordingly.




	

Ready.  Set.  Iterate!
