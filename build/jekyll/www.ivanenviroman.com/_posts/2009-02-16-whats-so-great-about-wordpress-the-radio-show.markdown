Sustainable Websites founder Ivan Storck will be on a live podcast tomorrow at 1pm PST. Call in with your WordPress questions!




Many people think that [WordPress](http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/wordpress-pie) is only for bloggers. Not true! Lee and Ivan will talk about why [WordPress](http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/wordpress-hosting) is such a great tool for entrepreneurs and small business owners, and how you can get started today.




I'll be introducing Sustainable Websites's new service [WordPress Pie](http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/wordpress-pie)!


The show airs live on Blog Talk Radio on Tuesday, February 17 from 1-2 PM Pacific time.




To tune in, go to [http://www.blogtalkradio.com/Dojo-Radio](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/Dojo-Radio).




Call **(646) 716-9210** while we're recording the show to share comments or questions. And if you want to participate in the chat room (always fun!) you'll need to first register at [www.blogtalkradio.com](http://www.blogtalkradio.com).  See you on the air!
