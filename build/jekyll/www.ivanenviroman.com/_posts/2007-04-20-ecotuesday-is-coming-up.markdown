I'm excited about finally being in town for this event! My friend Oren Jaffe is the co-host of [EcoTuesday](http://www.ecotuesday.com/), which is a forum to network, collaborate, and engage with environmental and socially responsible business leaders. Each month they create an interactive dialogue and feature a visionary speaker from the sustainable business world. This month, Jeff Slye (Business Evolution Consulting) and Michael Pace ([Serrano Hotel](http://www.serranohotel.com/)) will talk with us about the Kimpton Hotel's 'Earthcare' Program, greening the hotel industry, along with the interworkings between a company's green efforts and the benefits/challenges that come with outside support from a consultant. Don't forget to [RSVP](http://www.ecotuesday.com/register_04_24.html)!
