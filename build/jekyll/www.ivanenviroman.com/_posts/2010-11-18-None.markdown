![railszombies.png](http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/railszombies.png)[Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/) is an intriguing attempt to teach people how to use Ruby on Rails directly in the Web browser. It comes from [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com/) (and specifically Gregg Pollack, once of RailsEnvy fame).




The goal of Rails for Zombies is to make the learning process immediately accessible and fun. You're guaranteed to learn quite a bit too as the in-browser development environment frequently tests you and makes you actually _do stuff_ rather than merely read learning material.




As Gregg points out, what you learn through R4Z won't be quite enough for you to build your own version of Twitter (or even Twitter for zombies - _arf arf_) but it covers enough of the basics to put you in a better position to continue with more traditional learning techniques later.




_[suggestion]_ You know I launched [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/), a weekly Ruby e-mail newsletter? Well, last week I launched [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/) for all of you JS-heads too! It's been going great and the next issue is out later today.
