#### [UNEP-FI / UNITAR Online Course on Climate Change and Carbon Finance](http://www.unitar.org/unepfi/Info/Introduction.htm)

[![UNEP-FI / UNITAR Online Course on Climate Change and Carbon Finance](http://scst.srv.girafa.com/srv/i?i=sc010159&r=unitar.org/unepfi/Info/Introduction.htm&s=f1e8a9ab765a2a42)](http://www.unitar.org/unepfi/Info/Introduction.htm)

Using UNITAR's experience and pedagogical approach, this e-Learning course aims to share knowledge with financial institutions, both banks and insurers, and emphasizing the all-important role to be played by financial institutions in mitigating and adapting to climate change.

The course will provide an introduction to climate change and the science behind it, as well as emphasising how it will affect the financial services sector. Participants will be exposed to the policy and regulations in place, specifically the Kyoto Protocol and other regional policies. The course also aims to educate participants on the effect of climate change on energy financing and energy alternatives. Another important aspect of this course is the module on carbon finance, covering emissions trading as well as opportunities in the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation.
