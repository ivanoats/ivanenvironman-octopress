The study focused on 3 widely-deployed and commonly-used Microsoft applications for email, content sharing and customer relationship management. It then assessed the carbon footprint of server, networking and storage infrastructure for three different deployment sizes â€“ 100, 1,000 and 10,000 users.  

  

The results of the study revealed that the smaller the organization the larger the benefit of switching to cloud computing solutions. When small organizations (100 users) moved to the cloud instead of using their own servers, carbon emissions are likely to be 90% lower. For larger corporations the savings are typically 30% or more.
