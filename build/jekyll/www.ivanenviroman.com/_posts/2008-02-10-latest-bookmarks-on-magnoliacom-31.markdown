Usability and the utility, not the visual design, determine the success or failure of a web-site. Since the visitor of the page is the only person who clicks the mouse and therefore decides everything, user-centric design has established as a standard approach for successful and profit-oriented web design.

[![MarketingSherpa: Don't Make These Common Green Marketing Mistakes](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/chuxarafuj/thumbnail/160)](http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.php?ident=30323)

Hyping your business or products as environmentally friendly can attract eco-concerned consumers and boost overall customer affinity. But beware! It holds just as many risks. You could get slapped with “greenwashing” your brand. 

Here’s how to stay on the good side of hyper-sensitive green consumers and craft a message that makes everyone happy. Plus, lots of hotlinks to helpful resources.

Piston is a tool for keeping bits and pieces of your Subversion repository in sync with a remote repository. Like svn:externals, but better. How?

With Piston, you import a remote repository and check it into your local repository. You can then go nuts modifying it or periodically sync it up with its remote origin using piston update.
