I was recently invited to speak at the [Business of Organic](http://www.srinstitute.com/conf_page.cfm?instance_id=25&web_id=865&pid=472) conference on internet marketing in the organic food and beverage industry. I felt it was important to share some of the concepts of the current "web 2.0" thoughts on web marketing because in my experience with the food and beverage industry, most companies are not capitalizing on the power of community based, sustainable marketing. It's a natural fit, because the organic movement is based on the same principles. In fact, one of the main themes of the conference ended up being, is "organics" a movement, or an industry? Of course, it's now both - but I do believe because the movement came of age in the age of the interent - it will be harder for large corporations to co-opt the core philosophy and messages of the organic movement (witness some recent backlash) and it's important for marketing professionals in the organic industry to recognizes these forces at work, and take advantage of them instead of shying away. I'd like to thank the [Strategic Research Institute](http://www.srinstitute.com/)'s Tracy Jones very much for inviting me to speak, and my frequent collaborator in marketing projects, [Michael Phillips](http://www.tripletstudios.com), for adding the e-commerce angle, and the great authors that inspired me for the content of the presentation. Sorry there's no audio with these slides, we hope to add it later, or just [invite](http://www.ivanenviroman.com/hcard/) us to give the talk again!
