I fond some instructions on how to set up a [ruby on rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com) development environment using Eclipse. These instructions are not hard to convert to Mac OS X .  The only problems I had were:






  * I was using Eclipse 3.1 and the menu options were a little different


  * /usr/bin/ruby and /usr/bin/rails instead of c:\blah


  * I used 
    
    http://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/builds/release/0.6.0/updateSite/

for the updatesite URL because 0.5.0 is not compatible with Eclipse 3.1




Make sure you're on a reliable connection, as the download takes a while.
