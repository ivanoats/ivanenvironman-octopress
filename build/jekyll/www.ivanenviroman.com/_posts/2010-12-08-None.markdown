[WordPress 3.0.3 is available](http://wordpress.org/download/) and is a security update for all previous WordPress versions.




[This release](http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0.3) fixes issues in the remote publishing interface, which under certain circumstances allowed Author- and Contributor-level users to improperly edit, publish, or delete posts.




**These issues only affect sites that have remote publishing enabled.**




Remote publishing is disabled by default, but you may have enabled it to use a remote publishing client such as one of the WordPress mobile apps. You can check these settings on the “Settings → Writing” screen.




[Download 3.0.3](http://wordpress.org/download/) or update automatically from the “Dashboard → Updates” screen in your site’s admin area.
