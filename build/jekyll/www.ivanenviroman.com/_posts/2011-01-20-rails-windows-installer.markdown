I encourage my windows programmer friends to give Rails a try with the [Rails Windows Installer](http://railsinstaller.org/). There's now an easy installer. The Rails Welcome Kit has everything you need to hit the ground running. In one easy-to-use installer, you get all the common packages needed for a full Rails stack on Windows.
