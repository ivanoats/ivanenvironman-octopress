Chicago’s iconic [Willis Tower](http://inhabitat.com/sears-tower-going-green-with-350-million-renovation/) (formally the Sears Tower) is set to become a massive solar electric plant with the installation of a pilot [solar electric glass](http://inhabitat.com/solar-glass-generates-power-through-your-windows/) project. The high-profile project on the south side of the 56th floor will replace the windows with a new type of photovoltaic glass developed by [Pythagoras Solar](http://www.pythagoras-solar.com/) which preserves daylighting and views while reducing heat gain and producing the same energy as a conventional solar panel. The project could grow to 2 MW in size — which is comparable to a 10 acre field of solar panels — turning North America’s tallest building into a huge urban vertical solar farm.
