[![Cooking For Engineers - Recipe File: Pan Seared Scallops with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce](http://scst.srv.girafa.com/srv/i?i=sc010159&r=cookingforengineers.com/recipe/71/Pan-Seared-Scallops-with-Roasted-Red-Pepper-Sauce&s=969ad9b814e795ed)](http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/71/Pan-Seared-Scallops-with-Roasted-Red-Pepper-Sauce)

This is a seafood dish that can be thrown together quickly and yet tastes like you spent the entire afternoon in the kitchen. The briny, sweet flavor of the sea scallops is reinforced by the natural sweetness of the roasted red peppers that form the sauce.
