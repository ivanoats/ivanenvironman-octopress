For some of us, allergens are our worst enemy — the fresh [pollen](http://inhabitat.com/london-without-bees-conceptual-towers-shoot-pollen-spores-into-the-wind/) of spring, fall foliage, and of course the ever present dust, mold and animal dander. Sometimes the only solution is a high-tech [air filtration](http://inhabitat.com/yana-briggs-chevy-era-concept-cleans-up-polluted-cities/) system, but these complex systems can cost up to $800. But if you’re an allergy sufferer, today is your luck day as Dr. Jeffrey E. Terrell of the University of Michigan Health System’s Sinus Center shows us how to make our own easy air filtration system, for just $30!
