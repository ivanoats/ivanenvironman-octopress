#### [Satellite Photo Portfolio Website Generator](http://design.tedforbes.com/)

[![Satellite Photo Portfolio Website Generator](http://scst.srv.girafa.com/srv/i?i=sc010159&r=design.tedforbes.com&s=081bb28da5fc93b6)](http://design.tedforbes.com/)

Satellite™ is an all in one photo gallery website that takes advantage of Yahoo Flickr's image hosting and management tools. You can upload and manage your images using Flickr and host your portfolio on your own server via Satellite™.

When you upload images to Flickr, your website is automatically updated! You can further take advantage of Flickr's Organizer to create Photosets and assign Keywords to your images. All of the work you do on Flickr is mirrored on your website via Satellite™.

Satellite™ is CSS based, so you may customize its look and feel by downloading themes or creating your own.
