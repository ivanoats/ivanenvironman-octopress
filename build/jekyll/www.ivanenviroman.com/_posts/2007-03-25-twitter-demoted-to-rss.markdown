Twitter demoted to RSS. I love it, but it's too much, already. And now their website is super slow. I just fed it into Google Reader - this means I will check it a couple of times a day, along with all the other feeds I read. If there's a social event or news I am following I will turn on SMS on my phone (luckily I have like 1000 messages a month) but also Google Readers has a great WAP version so I can still be mobile and get twitters. Dodgeball is also now relegated to email. Since I bought the Blackjack, email/rss is good enough for me, because I get push email (when in the US) and WAP google reader for RSS.
