I'm sitting here at "Green Bloggers" at the [Commonwealth Club](http://www.commonwealthclub.org/) in San Francisco. Did [Eric Corey Freed](http://organicarchitecht.com) just bang the gavel? He is introducing  the [Green Bloggers](http://www.organicarchitect.com/events/bloggers.html) here at the commonwealth club. Nick Aster is a namedropper, according to ECF. (joking) And that's how this panel idea started.

[Gil Friend](http://www.natlogic.com)'s been blogging for three years, so he's an old pro, and his URL shows it.  radio.weblogs.com/0109... something. here it is: [http://radio.weblogs.com/0109157/
](http://radio.weblogs.com/0109157/)but look for blog.natlogic.com soon!

In attendance:


  * Nick Aster - [Triple Pundit](http://www.triplepundit.com)
  * Cayenne Sayer - [Treehugger](http://www.treehugger.com)
  * Siel - [Green LA Girl](http://www.greenlagirl.com) - To help LA be green
  * Jamais Casco - [Worldchanging](http://www.worldchanging.com) -Aim is highlight the models tools and ideas that can help improve life on the planet.
  * _Disclaimer:_ I was really spending most of the time listening to the talk but here are my notes for those that weren't there. I also heard that the audio was being recorded, you can probably ask Gil, ECF, or the Commonwealth Club about that. And I'm pretty sure I got at least two people's names spelled wrong, notify me in the comments and I'll correct._

Gil: Why did you choose blogging as your form of expression?_
Nick - ease of entry, moveable type,
Cayenne- easy to create content that your audience appreciates
Jamais - expounded on the "origin myth" of worldchanging.  An ideal forum for the kind of rapid-fire, broadly conceived idea generation that blogs enable.  Eats frosty mini-wheats.
Siel - "Food does not come from blogging. I'm trying to get a bike from running ads on my blog but that hasn't happened" I  support by blogging by going to grad school and teaching undergrads

Cayenne - Treehugger aims to achieve high ranking on Google. And is ad-supported
Nick -
Jamais - "a manifestation of my intellectual identify" similar to music

_Gil: What sort of results have you seen? how do you judge the effectiveness or satisfaction?_

Siel - "sometimes you feel like you're way out there, in terms of connections It's heartwarming. "
Jamais - "influencing the public discourse"

_Audience question: "How did you promote beyond your community?"_
Jamais - help from influential people like Cory Doctrow and Bruce Sterling
Nick - it's all about earning the respect of somebody else
Jamais - It's important to find people that are writing about similar issues and get them to link to you.
Seil - even if you're not so strategic, is concerned about creating a community around an issue

_Gil: What kinds of topics are you finding that are getting the most response from readers?_
Jamais - peak oil
Nick - it's random, GE ecomagination, vaguely politically controversial posts
Cayenne - technology and oil - there are sites like Gizmodo that are huge that link to us.  Mainstreaming of things, like organic standards.  Phasing out of print film vs. digital film by Nikon.
Seil - it's personal
Jamais - a post on diesel hybrid-electric car
_
What's in the future?_
Nick - blogging, collaboration, sites like del.icio.us
Cayenne -  Wists.com
Jamais - RSS  - a mechanism for being able to check multiple site updates.
