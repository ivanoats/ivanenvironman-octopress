[Investment Firm Seeking REC Proposals](http://www.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/news/news_template.shtml?id=1079):
RNK Capital LLC, a manager of environmental investments, announced that it is seeking to invest $25 million in the U.S. renewable energy and energy efficiency market and is inviting interested parties to submit an Expression of Interest. The company hopes to receive offers for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects that will result in renewable energy certificates, SO2 emissions allowances, NOX emissions allowances, or other environmental attributes. RNK Capital will consider either buying credits and allowances generated by projects, or providing debt financing for project development. Applications will be accepted and reviewed on a first-come-first-served basis.
