I organized a panel for the Business of Organics Conference Conference in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago. Here are the slides. Some really interesting stuff in there! Many thanks to [Michael Straus](http://www.strauscom.com/), [Gene Ruda, and Ed Zimmerman](http://www.successfoods.com/) for participating on the panel and making it a success, and the team at [SRI](http://www.almevents.com/conf_page.cfm?instance_id=29&web_id=1017&pid=625&prioritycode=DEM007902&k=) for inviting me for the second year in a row!
