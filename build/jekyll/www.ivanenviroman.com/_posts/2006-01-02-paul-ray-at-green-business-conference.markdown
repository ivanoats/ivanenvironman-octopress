Upcoming book: The Authenticity Factor

Authenticity - original meaning was being the author of your personal experience. 20th century philosophers talked about it. What brought it to the mainstream was the civil rights movement. **70% of consumers see big business as inauthentic**.  They are demanding transparency.


> _“If all you do is talk about your product you are giving away your best advantage over a big company”_

  * Personalize your company to target cultural creative consumers.  Customers want to go to the web to find out all about a product, where it comes from, the process used to make it, and who you are.
  * To gain market share you must **add extra benefits beyond green**: Better performance, health benefits, convenience, style, prestige, and now authenticity.
  * This fits right in with my belief that **word of mouth marketing is sustainable marketing.** Because word of mouth has to be authentic.
  * [Speech slides](http://www.coopamerica.org/pdf/summary_2005ray.pdf) are available in pdf format.
