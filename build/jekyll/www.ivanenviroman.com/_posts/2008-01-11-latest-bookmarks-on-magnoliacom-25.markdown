#### [  40 Million ‘Green Boomers’ In U.S. · Environmental Leader · Green Business and Corporate Sustainability News ](http://www.environmentalleader.com/2007/12/20/40-million-green-boomers-in-us/)

[![  40 Million ‘Green Boomers’ In U.S. · Environmental Leader · Green Business and Corporate Sustainability News ](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/jayina/thumbnail/160)](http://www.environmentalleader.com/2007/12/20/40-million-green-boomers-in-us/)

Forty million boomers use their purchasing power to buy environmentally safe brands, according to a survey from AARP Services and Focalyst.

This large, green boomer segment is often more demanding of quality in the products and services they buy, more attuned to advertising and exhibit higher brand loyalty than other boomers.

#### [Agile on a Fixed Budget](http://www.ddj.com/architect/201202925?cid=Ambysoft)

[![Agile on a Fixed Budget](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/frijubekim/thumbnail/160)](http://www.ddj.com/architect/201202925?cid=Ambysoft)

I'm often asked how you could possibly do agile software development given a fixed budget. The good news is that, yes, in many cases, it is in fact possible to work under these sorts of restrictions and still be agile. Because your budget isn't the only potential restriction you may face, this month I explore strategies for dealing with the common constraints your business stakeholders may choose to put on software development teams.

[![BusinessGreen blog: Why sometimes it's best to keep green messages to yourself](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/wrotedapu/thumbnail/160)](http://blog.businessgreen.com/2008/01/why-sometimes-i.html)

According to a new survey from BT of 600 UK consumers, just three per cent of customers think businesses are honest about their actions regarding what they are doing to become more environmentally or socially responsible.

That means every time your company releases a green ad or constructs a green marketing message just three out of every 100 customers believe you.
