This is really just a [domain forwarding and masking](https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/products/domain_forwarding.asp?prog_id=ivanstorck&ci=1781&) hack, but I think it could be useful. I've been entering in any event I find in the green and sustainability area to Yahoo's upcoming event calendar service, and tagging them with "sustainability". I also had the domain name [SustainabilityCalendar.com](http://www.SustainabilityCalendar.com) sitting around, doing nothing, after various aborted PHP projects.  So, I just used the [SustainableDomains.com](http://www.SustainableDomains.com)  (a reseller program with GoDaddy) [domain forwarding and masking](https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/products/domain_forwarding.asp?prog_id=ivanstorck&ci=1781&) service to point to the tag page for sustainability, and voil√†, [SustainabilityCalendar.com](http://www.SustainabilityCalendar.com) (or [SustainabilityCalendar.org](http://www.SustainabilityCalendar.org) ) is born.

Enjoy it, and please contribute by adding your own events to [Upcoming.yahoo.com](http://upcoming.yahoo.com), and tagging them with the tag "sustainability".  Don't forget, if your event is related to marketing, submit it to the ["Sustainable Marketing" group](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/159/), and after it is approved, will end up on the home page of [SustainableMarketing.com](http://www.sustainablemarketing.com), which gets over 15,000 unique visitors a month.
