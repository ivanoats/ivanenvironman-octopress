I'm working on a ruby wrapper to the WHM (Web Host Manager) XML API. [It is on GitHub](http://github.com/ivanoats/whm_xml_api_ruby) and it is under an MIT open source license. 

This code can be used to manage a reseller account on a web host that uses the WHM/Cpanel system. It can install new accounts, suspend/unsuspend accounts and other methods  

Currently it is unfinished and I am looking for some help to implement all the functions.
