"**Brand Innovation Manifesto** - How to Build Brands, Redefine Markets and Defy Conventions. The world’s biggest companies are pursuing a post-advertising strategy, moving away from advertising and investing in leading edge alternatives. In the vanguard of the revolution has been John Grant, co-founder of the legendary agency St. Luke’s and author of The New Marketing Manifesto, whose radical thinking has informed a generation."
