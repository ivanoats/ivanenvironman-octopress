Could we use the principles of peer to peer (or person to person - P2P ) file / data sharing to create a P2P grid for electricity? I'm not exactly sure how that would work, but I got the idea after reading about [how plug-in hybrids could be used to stabilize the electricity grid](http://feeds.treehugger.com/~r/treehuggersite/~3/65608302/plugin_hybrids_2.php). Searching the net, it appears as if this idea was written about in September 2005 by the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4245584.stm), reporting on the conclusions of a Southampton University project. They're called microgrids, which are "a collection of small generators for a collection of users in close proximity," explains Dr Markvart, whose research appears in the Royal Academy of Engineering's Ingenia magazine. Microgrids' premise is that electricity demand is split up and shared around the network of users, much like BitTorrent file sharing. "This microgrid appears to the larger grid as if it's any other customer. And it can quickly switch between operating on and off the grid: when the grid offers cheap electricity, the microgrid can purchase it, but if prices rise or there's a power failure, the microgrid can isolate itself. " - a lot of people say they want to live in a cabin off the grid - meaning far away from civilization. While I might think that's fine for a summer home, I like the idea of a neighborhood microgrid much better. It seems like there are still some legal issues to work out, and isn't always true with P2P technology?
