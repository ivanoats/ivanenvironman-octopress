1 in 4 consumers in the U.S. are in the LOHAS category. Almost half of LOHAS consumers say the products are too expensive. The second biggest barrier (43%) is unavailability of products in their regular stores. For non-LOHAS consumers, education is the second biggest barrier, also behind price.

Good news is LOHAS market segment is growing faster than the marketplace as a whole.
