Homemade Habanero Hummous



  
  * One can chickpeas (garbanzo beans)


  
  * About one quarter of a jar of tahini. Officially one to two gloms of tahini. You choose how much oil.


  
  * A glom of habenero sauce - we used the one we got at the Marylebone London farmers market from [Edible Ornamentals](http://edibleornamentals.co.uk/). It was called Inferno. She's there every other sunday, if you're in the neighborhood.


  
  * Lemon juice, and salt to taste.




We don't have a food processor, so the best thing I did was lay out the beans on a cutting board and mashed them with a fork first, then transferring them to a bowl to mix with the rest of the ingredients.







For the meal, we used some ingredients left in the fridge. Sauteed the ground beef, spinach, and yellow pepper, with assorted spices. Fresh tomatoes, and everything all together in a hot pita pocket. Voil√° le "Meeta Pocket". Our proximity to the Edgware road 'hood is definitely influencing our cooking at home. That and me buying a way too big bag of bulk couscous at [whole paycheck](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/UK/kensington/).




Tomorrow we're going to try [chicken guy](http://www.channel4.com/food/recipes/chefs/hugh-fearnley-whittingstall/stuffed_butternet_squash_p_1.html)'s Stuffed Butternut Squash recipe.




Anyone want to check the format of this for me in [hRecipe](http://microformats.org/wiki/recipe) [microformat](http://www.whymicroformats.com/)? Or have other cooking suggestions? Let me know in the comments.
