title: Installing Rails development stack on OS X Lion
wordpress_id: 2370
---

I recently started working with OS X Lion at home and started researching the best way to get a Ruby on Rails environment up and running quickly.





After a little searching, I found a really well written article by Frederico Araujo over at [http://www.frederico-araujo.com/2011/07/30/installing-rails-on-os-x-lion-with-homebrew-rvm-and-mysql/](http://www.frederico-araujo.com/2011/07/30/installing-rails-on-os-x-lion-with-homebrew-rvm-and-mysql/).





Fred's blog post walks you through step by step getting Homebrew, RVM, Ruby 1.9.2 and MySQL up and running.





It worked perfectly.





Thanks Fred!
