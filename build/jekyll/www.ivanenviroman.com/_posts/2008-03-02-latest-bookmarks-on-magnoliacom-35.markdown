    In an age of inconvenient truths, global warming, and “green is good” messages in the mass media, Sustainability has become a popular catchphrase and the new marketing must-have for many companies. But what does it truly mean? And how can it apply to your business? Contributing to the community in which you work can have far-reaching business effects, from positive brand recognition, to free networking and marketing, to a broader, better talent pool. Plus, it just makes for a better place to work and live. In this article, I’ll discuss how our web design and development company incorporated sustainability into our business model, and how other development companies can do the same

    Pay for royalty-free rights to articles for your site. This seems like a bit of a short-cut, but if you find the right article it may be very cost and time effective. And if you're a writer, you could get paid for your work. It's kind of like iStockPhoto for articles.

#### [Testing your Rails views with Hpricot — Luke Redpath](http://www.lukeredpath.co.uk/2006/7/7/testing-your-rails-views-with-hpricot)

    Rails comes with the built-in assert_tag method but I've always found it clunky and a pain in the arse to use.
