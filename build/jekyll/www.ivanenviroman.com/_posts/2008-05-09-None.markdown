Here are the slides from my [URUG (Utah Ruby User Group)](http://urug.org) presentation on 5/7/2008:

During the presentation I attempted to show some actual code. Using git I had previously walked through the different ways of using the rspec story runner (ruby with inlined steps, with steps libraries, and plain text with steps) and tagged the progress as I went. You can download the git repo and look at the different ways of using the story runner by checking out the different tags.





To list the tags simply type ‘git tag’ and to checkout a tag into a new branch type ‘git checkout -b tag_name tag_name’.
