                    Edit Flow offers a suite of functionality to redefine your editorial workflow within WordPress. Features include:

Custom Statuses - Create any number of custom statuses to define the stages of your editorial workflow. By default, Edit Flow adds "Assigned", "Pitch", and "Waiting for Feedback" to WordPress' default "Draft" and "Pending Review".
Editorial Comments - Threaded commenting in the WordPress admin on every post for discussion about the production of a given piece of content. This can cutdown on long-winded back-and-forth email threads as all comments are conveniently displayed within the Edit Post page.
Email Notifications - Receive email notifications for new editorial comments or when a post changes status. Notifications are delivered to admins and the post author by default, but any users that comment on posts will receive follow up email notifications.
More details and documentation can be found on the Edit Flow website
