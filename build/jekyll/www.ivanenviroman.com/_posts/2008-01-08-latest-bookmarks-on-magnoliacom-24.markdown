[![Andrzej on Software: A Guide to Deploying Rails Applications](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/xebasad/thumbnail/160)](http://andrzejonsoftware.blogspot.com/2008/01/guide-to-deploying-rails-applications.html)

I decided to start with a documentation of my deployment/development process. Then, I automated and simplified all I could and had time to. The result is a semi-automatic process which helps me with creating applications. This process is specialised for my needs and it uses the tools that I found useful. It doesn't have to be good for your needs. 
All the setup was focused on agility. I love to check-in frequently and be able to see the changes immediately on the production server. That's why I use tools like Capistrano or Vlad.
