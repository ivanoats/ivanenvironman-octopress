I'm not normally pimping random products but this one has me excited for the possibilities. I think the new Skystream 3.7 wind generator is a significant step forward in making wind power more accessible to the average homeowner (albeit in a fringe suburban, or rural setting).  I've heard it's designed to be installed by any electrician. According to Southwest, it's the first fully integrated wind generator designed specifically for the grid-connected residential market.  


> The small wind turbine produces electricity that is directly connected to the home energy supply, supplementing power from the electric utility company and enabling electricity to be produced for sale to the utility or used at a later date. With a typical cost of US$8,000 to US$10,000 to purchase and install, the Skystream 3.7 can pay for itself in 5 to 12 years. This payback period will vary and can be much quicker in locations with investment rebates or higher than average wind speeds.
