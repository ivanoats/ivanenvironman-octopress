#### [  Survey: Consumers Have Negative Perceptions Of Green Tech](http://www.environmentalleader.com/2008/01/15/survey-consumers-have-negative-perceptions-of-green-tech/)

[![  Survey: Consumers Have Negative Perceptions Of Green Tech](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/preruxiku/thumbnail/160)](http://www.environmentalleader.com/2008/01/15/survey-consumers-have-negative-perceptions-of-green-tech/)

While concern for the environment is at an all time high, according to Ecoalign, consumers think that many forms of green technology (renewable, energy efficient or recycled materials) are cost prohibitive, difficult to understand and maintain, and aesthetically unappealing.

#### [The Blogger's Guide to Search Engine Optimization  - by Aaron & Giovanna Wall : SEO Book.com](http://www.seobook.com/bloggers)

[![The Blogger's Guide to Search Engine Optimization  - by Aaron & Giovanna Wall : SEO Book.com](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/miscupone/thumbnail/160)](http://www.seobook.com/bloggers)

While we wrote a 300+ page book about SEO, only a dozen pages are needed to cover how to do SEO for a blog. Why? As search improves, Google and other search engines collect more data, which allows them to recommend and rank blogs based on how well people trust those blogs.
