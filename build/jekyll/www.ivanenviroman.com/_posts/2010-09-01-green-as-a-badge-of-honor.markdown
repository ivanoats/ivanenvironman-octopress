As the green world evolves, so does our thinking about it. For the last few years, we have departed from the conventional wisdom that said the green marketing message should be “saving the planet one ‘whatever’ at a time” but instead we’ve driven home the message that that it needs to be a balance of personal gain and planetary benefit. In other words, bringing the green message down to earth is a necessity for a successful and motivational message.  

  

It’s gratifying for us to see the other green marketing gurus whom we respect embrace that message even as we begin to refine it and shift our emphasis even more. We now see “green as a badge of honor” as a message worth exploring.
