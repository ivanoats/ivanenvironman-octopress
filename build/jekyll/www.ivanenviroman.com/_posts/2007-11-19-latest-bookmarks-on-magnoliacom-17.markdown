Congress is now taking climate change fairly seriously

TO SEE how the mood in Congress is changing on global warming, look no further than America's Climate Security Act (ACSA). This is a bill that seeks to limit and ultimately slash America's emissions of greenhouse gases. For one thing, it is sponsored by John Warner, a Republican who once opposed all such measures. For another, it has won the support of Max Baucus, a senator from Montana, whose coal-mining constituents hate the idea. It has already cleared more legislative hurdles than any of the many previous bills on global warming.

[![BenCurtis.com  » OpenID Sample Application](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/vraloshi/thumbnail/160)](http://www.bencurtis.com/archives/2007/05/openid-sample-application/)

Here’s a follow-up to my instructions on integrating OpenID with ActsAsAuthenticated: a full, sample Ruby on Rails application that provides an example of how to use OpenID. Much like the caboose sample app(s), this is intended to be a good starting point for building your own application with OpenID baked in from the beginning.
