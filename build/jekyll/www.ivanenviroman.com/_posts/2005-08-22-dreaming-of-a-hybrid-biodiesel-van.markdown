I used to have a VW Eurovan that I toured the country with (Maine to California!) - I had to give it up, but now am thinking about my new dream vehicle - as soon as it becomes available (and somehow I come up with an extra $50K ! (not likely) - a [Diesel-Electric Plug-In Hybrid](http://www.gizmag.com/go/3906/) Mercedes/Dodge Sprinter Van, customized by [Sportsmobile](http://www.sportsmobile.com/2_sr_classc_sc200.html).
