#### [  Survey: Consumers Have Negative Perceptions Of Green Tech](http://www.environmentalleader.com/2008/01/15/survey-consumers-have-negative-perceptions-of-green-tech/)

[![  Survey: Consumers Have Negative Perceptions Of Green Tech](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/preruxiku/thumbnail/160)](http://www.environmentalleader.com/2008/01/15/survey-consumers-have-negative-perceptions-of-green-tech/)

Marketing agency EcoAlign says its second EcoPinion Survey provides evidence of a green gap between willingness to adopt or purchase green products, services and technologies, and consumer value perceptions around those offerings. While concern for the environment is at an all time high, according to Ecoalign, consumers think that many forms of green technology (renewable, energy efficient or recycled materials) are cost prohibitive, difficult to understand and maintain, and aesthetically unappealing.

#### [The Blogger's Guide to Search Engine Optimization  - by Aaron & Giovanna Wall : SEO Book.com](http://www.seobook.com/bloggers)

[![The Blogger's Guide to Search Engine Optimization  - by Aaron & Giovanna Wall : SEO Book.com](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/miscupone/thumbnail/160)](http://www.seobook.com/bloggers)

While we wrote a 300+ page book about SEO, only a dozen pages are needed to cover how to do SEO for a blog. Why? As search improves, Google and other search engines collect more data, which allows them to recommend and rank blogs based on how well people trust those blogs.

#### [Google Feed API](http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/2007/04/google-feed-api-json.html)

[![Google Feed API](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/culeruqesc/thumbnail/160)](http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/2007/04/google-feed-api-json.html)

Google Reader finally has its first official API. Any developer in the world can request the entire history of a web feed from Google's geo-distributed server cloud in a normalized response for inclusion in their websites or products. I've been hoping for such an API since I first deconstructed the Google Reader backend in December 2005. Most users will likely interact with the Google AJAX Feed API through a JavaScript library included on their site or a pre-configured badge generated on the Google site. The Feed API wrapper is part of a larger effort by Google to extend its search...
