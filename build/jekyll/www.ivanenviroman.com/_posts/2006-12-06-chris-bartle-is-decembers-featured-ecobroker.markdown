I'd like to congratulate Chris Bartle for his recognition as an [EcoBroker](http://www.ecobroker.com) . The [Green Key Real Estate](http://www.greenkeyrealestate.com) founder and owner is featured on EcoBroker for the month of December.  EcoBroker is the program designed to  help communities, across the United States and internationally, take advantage  of and encourage energy efficiency and sustainable design in real estate  properties. He also has a [recent interview](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/the_treehugger_1.php) on [Treehugger](http://www.treehugger.com/).

I worked on the design and devleopment of Chris's web site last year and continue to do a little bit of work on it. The most recent addition is the [Recommended Professionals directory](http://www.greenkeyrealestate.com/directory/) and [Green Key Real Estate Blog](http://www.greenkeyrealestate.com/blogsection/Blog/) which are both great resources for eco san franciscans.

Chris also runs the [Green Business](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SustainableBusinessHappyHourSF/) [Green Drinks](http://www.greendrinks.org/) [San Francisco](http://www.biothinking.com/greendrinks/index.php?country=USA&city=San%20Francisco-Green%20Business) at [Elixir](http://www.elixirsf.com/). By the way, [Carroll Moore](http://rdlab.com/) and I co-organize the [East Bay Green Drinks](http://www.eastbaygreendrinks.org) in Berkeley.
