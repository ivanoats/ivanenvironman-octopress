It really combined my favorite things - being outside, geeking it out, great conversations, wine, yoga, community and swimming through a cave!

An impromptu, "un-conference" - the participants created the sessions saturday morning, held them outside on saturday during the day, and then Sunday we decamped to a winery to code some of the things we were talking about. I ended up meeting the [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) and [CivicSpace](http://civicspacelabs.org) [super](http://civicspacelabs.org/home/blog/kieran) [rock](http://www.delocalizedham.com) [stars](http://zacker.org/)! and we're working on a video/screencast together to highlight how the software can help non-profits, and chatted about how to improve the Drupal theme system. Neil says that more .tpl files instead of functions are headed our way, which [Mani](http://www.manisheriar.com/blog/) will love.

I had a great ride up there thanks to [Eddie](http://www.geekentertainment.tv/) and [Sarah](http://www.sarahpullman.com/) (who organized a serene outdoor [yoga for geeks](http://www.yogaforgeeks.com) session Sunday morning!). I had an fun conversation with [Tara](http://www.horsepigcow.com/) ( one of the organizers, thanks!) about [pinko marketing](http://pinkomarketing.pbwiki.com/), and it's commonalities an differences with my emerging idea of [sustainable marketing](http://www.sustainablemarketing.com).  Many thanks to [Chris](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/), [Andrew](http://www.rfwine.com/), the bands, and others for organizing such an inspiring and fun event.
