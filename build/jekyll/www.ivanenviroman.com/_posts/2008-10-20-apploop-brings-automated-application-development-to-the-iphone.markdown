Finally! I am excited about the ability to create an iPhone application with only my knowledge of web server programming. All the app has to do is produce an RSS feed for reading. Imagine a custom [Green Web Hosting](http://www.sustainablewebsites.com) news feed, or a [Sustainable and Green Marketing](http://www.sustainablemarketing.com) Clippings feed.

  With the [iPhone SDK](http://tuaw.com/category/SDK), Apple is pioneering a new mobile development platform that is ahead of it's time; however, this innovation comes with a major caveat: It requires Cocoa (or [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-c)) programming knowledge. You may ask "Why is this a problem?" Well, someone might have a really great idea for an iPhone application, but not have the programming knowledge to back it up and follow through with the idea. This is where [AppLoop](http://apploop.com/) comes in.  

    

  AppLoop is a brand-new service that allows anyone with a web browser and [RSS](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed to create an application similar to the [AP News app](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284901416&mt=8) and submit it to the App Store -- without ever writing a single line of code. Their service works by generating a .plist file on the server side (based on your choices). The file is then passed through a couple of AppleScripts that generates the code based on the choices, and compiles it.  

    

  The entire app-creation process takes less than a minute to complete, and you have an application ready to be deployed to the [App Store](http://tuaw.com/category/App-Store). Ad-hoc versions can be requested in advance of the app being placed on the App Store. Currently, AppLoop is offering the RSS reader application, but they have plans to add additional paid features down the road.  

    

  You can find out more information about this service by visiting [their website](http://apploop.com/), or by watching the video [[link here](http://www.vimeo.com/1980009?pg=embed&sec=1980009)] above. You can also see a [gallery of screenshots](http://www.tuaw.com/photos/apploop-demo-applications/) from one of their applications.
