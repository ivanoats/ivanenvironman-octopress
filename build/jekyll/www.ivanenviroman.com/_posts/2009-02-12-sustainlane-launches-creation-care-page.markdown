[![creation care on sustainlane](http://www.ivanenviroman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/creationcare-sustainlane20090211-tm.jpg)](http://www.ivanenviroman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/creationcare-sustainlane20090211.png)
SustainLane, your everything [go green](http://www.sustainlane.com/) web portal has launched a page with articles and resources for evangelical environmentalists. Also known as the topic of [Creation Care](http://www.sustainlane.com/directory/creation-care), the greening of Christianity has the potential to reach a growing audience in the U.S. It's a group of people that could have a big impact on environmental issues becoming part of the political and social mainstream.


> On SustainLaneâ€™s Creation Care page, you will find links to a growing body of content provided by SustainLane contributors: peer reviews, blogs and news that cover a myriad of creation care topics and controversies related to the greening of faith and environmental stewardship that began in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve.


It's a brave choice for SustainLane, because typically the green movement has been associated with the scientific and politically liberal communities.(Not to say there aren't some liberal christians, because there are many). They do run the risk of alienating a few "extreme green" users, but also the potential of attracting many more. It's an important step to bridge the divide that has existed in the environmental movement.


Full Disclosure: SustainLane has contracted me on retainer to help with internet marketing activities.
