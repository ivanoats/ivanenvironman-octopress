#### [WorldChanging San Francisco: Green Coworking: Interview with Chris Messina and Ivan Storck of Citizen Space](http://www.worldchanging.com/local/sanfrancisco/archives/006980.html)

[![WorldChanging San Francisco: Green Coworking: Interview with Chris Messina and Ivan Storck of Citizen Space](http://scst.srv.girafa.com/srv/i?i=sc010159&r=worldchanging.com/local/sanfrancisco/archives/006980.html&s=d3dff0685fda5f95)](http://www.worldchanging.com/local/sanfrancisco/archives/006980.html)

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, almost half (49 percent) of the nation’s businesses are operated from home. Working from home provides amazing freedom, but with that freedom can come isolation. Community and opportunities for collaboration can be lost when it is just you sitting down to work each day.

Coworking, a group of individual entrepreneurs sharing a work space, can provide that community while also being an environmentally sustainable choice.

If you're in SF and need a place to work for a few hours, I invite you to stop by.
