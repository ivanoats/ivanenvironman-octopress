I'm pretty busy with the [Green Festival](http://www.greenfestivals.org/content/view/626/281/) in San Francisco this weekend but have a minute to copy and paste this message from Kiva:

I just made a loan to someone in the developing world using a revolutionary website called [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/).

You can go to Kiva's website and lend to someone in the developing world who needs a loan for their business - like raising goats, selling vegetables at market or making bricks. Each loan has a picture of the entrepreneur, a description of their business and how they plan to use the loan so you know exactly how your money is being spent - and you get updates letting you know how the business is going. The best part is, when the entrepreneur pays back their loan you get your money back - and Kiva's loans are managed by microfinance institutions on the ground who have a lot of experience doing this, so you can trust that your money is being handled responsibly.

I just made a loan to an entrepreneur named Cynder Gael Medina Cuenca in Peru. They still need another $50.00 to complete their loan request of $275.00 (you can loan as little as $25.00!). Help me get this business off the ground by clicking on the link below to make a loan to Cynder Gael Medina Cuenca too:

It's finally easy to actually do something about poverty - using Kiva I know exactly who my money is loaned to and what they're using it for. And most of all, I know that I'm helping them build a sustainable business that will provide income to feed, clothe, house and educate their family long after my loan is paid back.

Join me in changing the world - one loan at a time.
