Last night Â I went to my first Seattle WordPress Meetup. It was big! Over 60 people showed up. This is a great turn out, equal to the size of the ones I used to organize in San Francisco.

The speaker was [Jason Schuller](http://www.thesevenfive.com/), WordPress theme guru and entrepreneur. His talk was inspiring for any designer thinking about basing a business around WordPress themes. You can get the gist of it from his latest two [blog](http://www.thesevenfive.com/life-after-my-day-job-how-i-monetized-my-passion/) [posts](http://www.thesevenfive.com/three-things-to-consider-when-launching-any-new-online-business/). I'm hoping the slides will be posted to the [Seattle WordPress Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/SeattleWordPressMeetup/) group soon.



In no particular order and not even close to complete here are my own notes from the talk.








	
  * Pick a niche within word press, for example cafes or videos

	
  * CSS - make a table of contents for a long css file

	
  * Custom theme options

	
  * [Press75.com](http://press75.com)

	
  * Theme packages, Child Themes for Genesis and Headway 2.0 framework

	
  * Other WP peeps to know: Brian Gardner, massivepress.com

	
  * Put your product forward (screenshots on home page)


**Why was he successful?**



	
  * Know your competition but don't copy them

	
  * Quality. Not quantity.

	
  * Let your passion drive you.
