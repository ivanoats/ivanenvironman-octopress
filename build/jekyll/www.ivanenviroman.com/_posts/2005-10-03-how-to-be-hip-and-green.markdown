I'm glad that others are pointing out this sad but true fact in green marketing: If you are perceived as too green, all kinds of negative feedback loops start to happen. Your product could be associated with hippies, who (although I am a closet one) aren't really the height of 'cool' anymore. Even worse, your product could be thought of as more expensive, a fate that happens to organic food frequently, and even lightbulbs.  As Joel Makower says, people are looking for "green without compromise".

What does this mean? Am I renouncing green marketing? No, I'm just pointing out that your product marketing has to be firing on all cylinders - solid marketing fundamentals - let people know the benefits of your product, but don't make them all environmental benefits.
