While using the command-line shell, BASH (for Unixen, part of GNU (GNU's Not Unix), developed by FSF (Free Software Foundation), quite popular and superior), for a long time I employed just a few of its manipulation features for command lines -- just these, in fact:
  
!$ - last command's last argument
  
(C-r) - reverse search, through command history
  

  
Recently, I have wanted to combine multiple arguments from multiple commands. To help me remember how, I used the technique of making a cheat sheet. Interestingly, BASH is similar to the text editor, Emacs (as well as Nano). Here is a sample:
  

  
Key abbreviations:
  
(C-) - Ctrl
  
(M-) - Alt
  
(newline) - Enter
  
(rubout) - Backspace
  

  
Move the cursor:
  
(C-a) - beginning-of-line
  
(C-e) - end-of-line
  
(M-f) - forward-word
  
(M-b) - backward-word
  

  
Change text:
  
(M-t) - transpose-words
  

  
Kill and yank:
  
(C-k) - kill-line
  
(C-x rubout) - backward-kill-line
  
(M-d) - kill-word
  
(C-y) - yank
  

  
Completing:
  
(tab) - complete
  
(M-/ M-/) - complete-filename
  
(M-g) - glob-complete-word
  
(M-?) - possible-completions
  
(C-x /) - possible-filename-completions
  

  
Miscellaneous:
  
(C-_) - undo
  

  
Event designators:
  
(!-2) - command previous to last
  
(!-2:1-2) - second previous commands's first and second arguments
  
(!-2:0 !:3* !-2:2) - second previous command word plus its second argument, the last command's third and following arguments intervening
