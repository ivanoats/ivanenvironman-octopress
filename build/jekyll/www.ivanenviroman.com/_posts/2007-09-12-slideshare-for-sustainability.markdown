There are many [presentations about sustainability](http://www.slideshare.net/tag/sustainability) available on the slide-sharing service [SlideShare.net](http://www.slideshare.net). Why share your slides? Well, think about the increase in exposure for your ideas and brand that you can achieve by participating, and helping to create online community for slides specific to sustainability issues. -- just by tagging your slideshow with relevant keywords like sustainability, organics, etc.





> _(from the slideshare.net FAQ)_ You can upload your PowerPoint, OpenOffice, Keynote or PDF files, tag them, embed them into your blog or website, browse others' presentations, and comment on individual slides. What's more, the transcripts of your presentation will be indexed by internet search engines and show up in search results. It's a great way to share your ideas with others, or to learn from other people.





Ideally, I'd have time to create a website that interfaces with their [Slideshare API](http://www.slideshare.net/developers) to allow users to post and tag presentations directly from [SustainableMarketing.com](http://www.SustainableMarketing.com) - one of these weeks when I have a few days just to play with Ruby





_Edit:_ I created a Slideshare group called SustainableMarketing for collecting examples of good presentations related to the topic of sustainable marketing. Join the group to be notified of updates and add examples of great slide shows!
