#### [Work while traveling | Laptop Hobo](http://laptophobo.com/)

[![Work while traveling | Laptop Hobo](http://scst.srv.girafa.com/srv/i?i=sc010159&r=laptophobo.com&s=d8b4ab127d2453b5)](http://laptophobo.com/)

A community of travelers working and living as they travel abroad. Laptop Hobo is a new resource for those who wish to take their "at-home" jobs with them while they travel and live abroad. We’ll share with you what we know about the process of going from work-at-home to work-anywhere-you-damn-well-please. We can even help you if you do not have a “work-at-home” vocation, or haven’t traveled anywhere before.

Do you ever wish you could win the lottery, chuck the rat race, and take off to explore the world? Heck—who hasn't? These days, however, there's a group of independent-minded, techno-savvy entrepreneurs who are turning that dream into a reality. They call themselves New Nomads, and they've transformed work-at-home into work-anywhere-you-damn-well-please

#### [About the Working Nomad](http://www.workingnomad.com/about-working-nomad.htm)

[![About the Working Nomad](http://scst.srv.girafa.com/srv/i?i=sc010159&r=workingnomad.com/about-working-nomad.htm&s=bdf0cb01152f0dff)](http://www.workingnomad.com/about-working-nomad.htm)

I am a 35 year old from England who started the whole travel thing when I was 30. My 20s were spent working hard in London as an I.T. Contractor and a corporate slave.

I have been working as a freelance web designer and now professional backpacker! Travel changed my view on life and I quickly realised that working for big business and climbing the corporate ladder was n't for me.
