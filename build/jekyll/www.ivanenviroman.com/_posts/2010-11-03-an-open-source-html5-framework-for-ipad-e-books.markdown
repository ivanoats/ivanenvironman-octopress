The ability to use HTML5 seems to be a a great way to democratize the publishing of e-books. Almost anyone can learn HTML. Add to that the graphic effects that HTML5 brings to the table, and it's a recipe for beautifully designed e-books. I'm thinking it would be a nice way of making a personal photography ebook.
