#### [Nutrition Professionals Market Research Reports](http://www.research-sight.com/Nutrition_Professionals.html)

[![Nutrition Professionals Market Research Reports](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/prastozaw/thumbnail/160)](http://www.research-sight.com/Nutrition_Professionals.html)

The health of the planet and the health of the people are intricately
linked. Holistic Nutrition Professionals emphasize fresh, whole, organic
foods and these are the same foods that can help one lead a happy, healthy
and sustainable lifestyle that benefits not only themselves but also our
children and the planet. As such, strategic market analysis designed to help
Nutrition Professionals achieve their business goals is also useful to the
sustainability community. We hope that this new analysis by ResearchSight
and Bauman College will be leveraged by everyone who seeks to improve the
health of the planet and the world's citizens.

[![Mapstraction - a javascript library to hide differences between mapping APIs.](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/clocohegech/thumbnail/160)](http://mapstraction.com/)

Mapstraction is a library that provides a common API for various javascript mapping APIs to enable switching from one to another as smoothly as possible. Developers can code their applications once, and then easily switch mapping provider based on project needs, terms and conditions, and new functionality.

Users can switch maps as desired based on personal taste and quality of maps in their local area. Various tools built on top of Mapstraction allow users to easily integrate maps into their own sites, and configure them with different controls, styles, and provider.
