My old friend [Eamon Javers has just started a new blog calledÂ ](http://thespypost.com/)[TheSpyPost](http://thespypost.com/). He also was on the Daily Show, check out the video below to learn about CIA agents moonlighting in corporate espionage.

I spent a year and a half interviewing current and former corporate spies -- including veterans of the CIA, MI5 and Soviet Intelligence -- to learn how companies are using the same techniques that government spies use. And I reveal that the CIA has a secret moonlighting program in which active duty agents are allowed to work in the private sector in their off time to make more money.
