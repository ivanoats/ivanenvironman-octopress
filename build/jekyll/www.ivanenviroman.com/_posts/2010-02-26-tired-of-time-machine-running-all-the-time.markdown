This is probably because it starts a backup after the computer wakes from sleep.




If you're like me, and don't need hourly backups -- one a day will do, thanks -- there is a free program called [TimeMachineEditor](http://timesoftware.free.fr/timemachineeditor/) that lets you set a backup schedule. I have mine set for 2:30am so that it does not intrude on my work day.
