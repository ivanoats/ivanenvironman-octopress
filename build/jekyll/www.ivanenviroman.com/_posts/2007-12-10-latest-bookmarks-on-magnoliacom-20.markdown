#### [The Foundation for P2P Alternatives - P2P Foundation](http://www.p2pfoundation.net)

[![The Foundation for P2P Alternatives - P2P Foundation](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/fisuwuh/thumbnail/160)](http://www.p2pfoundation.net)

We function as a clearinghouse for open/free, participatory/p2p and commons-oriented initiatives.
We aim to be a pluralist network to document, research, and promote peer to peer alternatives. Our political aims could be summarized under the following maxims:
ending the destruction of the biosphere by abandoning the dangerous conceptions of pseudo-abundance in the natural world (i.e. based on the assumption that natural resources are infinite);
promoting free cultural exchange by abandoning the innovation-inhibiting conceptions of pseudo-scarcity in the cultural world (i.e. based on the assumption that the free flow of culture needs to be restricted through excessive copyrights etc...).
