I've been working on my old laptop while I'm waiting for a new keyboard for my mac. And because it's fun to play with ubuntu linux. I found a way to add my iDisk. This is a little more geeky than the average post here, but it needed to be on the web in case someone else got stuck.  


  1. Go to the Places Menu
  2. Choose Connect to Server
  3. Select Service type: WebDAV
  4. Enter Server: idisk.mac.com
  5. enter your username
  6. Leave the other fields blank, or enter in a folder (you might need your username there)
  7. Press Connect
TODO: Figure out a way to synch a local folder to the iDisk (feel free to comment!)
