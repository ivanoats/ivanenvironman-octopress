No, this post is not about about some African bluegrass band. 

SustainLane's show about helping kids [go green](http://www.sustainlane.com) is called [Green Gorilla](http://www.greengorilla.com). This new episode is about mountaintop removal. Mountaintop removal is a radical form of coal mining in which entire mountains are literally blown up -- and it is happening here in America on a scale that is almost unimaginable. The show is fun, even for adults. It's not too long, so you can totally get away with watching it at work.



You might think because you don't live in the Appalachians, it does not affect you, but almost every state has power that is generated by coal.
