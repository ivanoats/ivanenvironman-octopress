I used an online service called [Ning](http://www.ning.com) to make a [map of green businesses](http://www.greenbusinessmap.com). You can submit your green business or search for others near you using an easy google-maps interface. My [green web hosting](http://www.sustainablewebsites.com) customers already know about this new project, but I have been holding off on telling others about it. Growth seems to have reached a plateau around 60 or so sites, so I think it's time to open it up to a wider audience to test it out.  The criteria is pretty loose for listing, I only ask that you get one of the various [eco label certifications](http://www.ecolabels.org) out there for green business. There's no approval mechanism yet, so I hope it doesn't get spammed or Exxon lists itself on it. But there is a rating system built in so that others can rate each green business on a 1-5 star level.

Thanks to Gina and others at Ning for help getting it running. I am very intrigued about the Ning platform. I think a lot of people without programming skills will really like it. However, as a developer/entrepreneur I am not sure about the revenue generating capability of it - because you're not allowed to run advertisements on the site. The whole site is really in a beta stage, there are some performance slowdowns occationally. However, I am optimistic that Ning will be a really big thing soon.
