Via [Treehugger](http://www.treehugger.com): Thanks to the Italian textile manufacturer [Crespi 1797](http://www.crespi1797.it/DefaultITA.htm) Italians (and other [flax](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/flax_a_mini_eco.php) fans) will be able to flaunt beautiful organic linen at the beach.  The newly certified fabric will be made from organic fiber and will use heavy-metal free dyes.
