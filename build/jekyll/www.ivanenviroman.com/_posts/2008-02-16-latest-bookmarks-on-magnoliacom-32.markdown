#### [Code Intensity: Auto-Complete Text Fields in Rails 2](http://codeintensity.blogspot.com/2008/02/auto-complete-text-fields-in-rails-2.html)

[![Code Intensity: Auto-Complete Text Fields in Rails 2](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/qeturel/thumbnail/160)](http://codeintensity.blogspot.com/2008/02/auto-complete-text-fields-in-rails-2.html)

In Rails 2, the PrototypeHelper and ScriptaculousHelper code was removed to plugins. This means that doing auto-complete for various fields was no longer part of the base Rails. I didn't find any great, straight-forward docs on how to do this for Rails 2.x, so am sharing what I've done to hopefully help others

#### [assert{ 2.0 } - O'Reilly Ruby](http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2008/02/assert2.html)

[![assert{ 2.0 } - O'Reilly Ruby](http://ma.gnolia.com/bookmarks/durewelob/thumbnail/160)](http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2008/02/assert2.html)

Phlip likea developer tests, but he doesn’t like the primitive assertions - assert_equal, assert_match, assert_not_nil, etc. They only exist for one reason - to print out their input values when they fail. And they don’t even reflect their variable names.

So Phlip wrote an assertion to replace all of them. Put whatever you want into it; it prints out your expression, and all its values.
