[![The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1165384260m/4099.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer_From_Journeyman_to_Master) [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer_From_Journeyman_to_Master) by [Andrew Hunt](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2812.Andrew_Hunt)  
  

My rating: [4 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/72957057)
A little dated if you're using a framework like Ruby on Rails, but definitely worth reviewing and further study. Lots of great practices. I feel like this book gives you the foundational understanding to what inspired many current Ruby on Rails practices.
