Another quote, this time in a [BrandWeek article](http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/spotlight/article_display.j%0Asp?vnu_content_id=1003574857) on Green marketing of organics and clothing:




> As Ivan Storck, owner of SustainableMarketing.com, put it, there is a triple bottom line: people, planet, and profit, and the people part of the equation must come first. "Sustainability means more than being eco-friendly," he said. "Sustainability also means you're in it for the long haul."





Congrats also to [Jerry Savage](http://www.research-sight.com/), and his new company [Research-Sight](http://www.research-sight.com/) - lots of great quotes from him in there. Thanks to Sandra O'Loughlin for interviewing us.
