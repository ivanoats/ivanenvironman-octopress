[Clean tech investing to hit $1.5 billion this year ](http://news.com.com/2061-11204_3-5863405.html?part=rss&tag=5863405&subj=news)

> 
 Venture capitalists sunk $369 million into start-ups promoting alternative energy and products that leave less of a dent on the environment during the second quarter, according to the CleanTech Venture Network




The article notes that alternative energy is most heavily invested in but up and coming is also water purification and treatment. Hmmm.. a tech boom that is also good for the environment? Is it possible?
