SpeakerText is an integrated suite of premium services for publishers who want the videos on their site to be found, shared and accessed by everyone. They provide high quality, low cost interactive transcripts to help your videos get viral.  

  

Video to Text  

SpeakerText combines artificial and human intelligence to offer  video transcription. Once you connect SpeakerText to a video hosting platform––we currently support Brightcove, YouTube and Blip.tv––SpeakerText automatically downloads your videos, turns them into text and loads the text onto your website.  

  

The SpeakerBar  

Once a video has been transcribed, SpeakerText loads an interactive transcript player beneath each video. Dubbed the SpeakerBar, this player allows visitors to use the text as an interactive controller for the video. Visitors can use the SpeakerBar to search and navigate within the video as well as share video quotes on Facebook and Twitter that link back to the video.
