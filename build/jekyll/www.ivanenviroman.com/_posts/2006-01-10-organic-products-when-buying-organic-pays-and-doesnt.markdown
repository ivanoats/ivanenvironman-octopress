[ConsumerReports.org - Organic products, when buying organic pays (and doesn't)](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/food/organic-products-206/when-buying-organic-pays-and-doesnt.htm?resultPageIndex=1&resultIndex=1&searchTerm=organic): Good to see Consumer Reports weighing in on the organic standards debate. Actually, they've been quite good about promoting sustainability, one of their previous sites is about [Eco Labels](http://www.ecolabels.org).  The one thing I would add to this article is that I do buy sustainable seafood - from family / independent fishing vessels and also am a bit partial to [Lush](http://usa.lush.com/) soaps and stuff.  Even though they're not totally organic they are getting close.
