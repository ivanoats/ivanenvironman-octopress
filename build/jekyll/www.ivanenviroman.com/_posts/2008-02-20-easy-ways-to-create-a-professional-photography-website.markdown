There are so many options available to photographers to create a professional looking portfolio site. Here are just a few I've run across in the past couple of months.




[SmugMug.com](http://www.smugmug.com/pro/) offers template based sites and includes a way to sell your photos, printing, and custom watermarks.




[Satellite](http://design.tedforbes.com/) powered by a [flickr](http://flickr.com) [professional account](http://flickr.com/upgrade/). You also need a [web hosting](http://www.sustainablewebsites.com) account that supports the [php](http://php.net/) programming language to install Satellite on. You don't have to know any php - but [knowing some basic HTML](http://w3schools.com/html/default.asp) helps. Despite all these steps, this is my current favorite because it's customizable, can be hosted on many website accounts, and gives you a real web hosting account to play with, which gives you additional benefits of having you@yourdomainname.com email, and the ability to install a [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) blog like the one you are reading now. To see an example of a Satellite powered site I recently created for a friend, check out [Colleen Todd](http://colleentodd.com)'s. portfolio.




Worried about copying of your images? Consider using steganography (like [DigiMarc](http://www.digimarc.com/register/) in Adobe Photoshop) to digitally watermark your photos, although it has been said it reduces quality. An alternative is to put a "bug" in a corner of the image with your name. This can be done in batch mode with a program like [iWatermark](http://www.scriptsoftware.com/iwatermark/). Personally, I prefer the bug method, for reasons [Ken Rockwell](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/digimark.htm) explains.




Want to include a slideshow widget on your site? Check out the Google AJAX Feed [Slideshow widget](http://www.google.com/uds/solutions/slideshow/index.html).




Do it yourself portfolios: (free) [http://start.uber.com/design](http://start.uber.com/design) can be used for photography or any artwork.  





If you have a mac, you may already have the the [Apple iLife](http://www.apple.com/ilife/) suite, including [iPhoto](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/) and [iWeb](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/) and a dotMac account which can help you make a decent looking portfolio site.




If any of the above methods doesn't give you a professional web address (URL) of your own, like www.mynamephotos.com - you can use [domain masking](https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/products/domain_forwarding.asp?prog_id=ivanstorck&ci=1781&) at a registrar (like [SustainableDomains.com](https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/products/domain_forwarding.asp?prog_id=ivanstorck&ci=1781&)) to point to the computer generated URL.
