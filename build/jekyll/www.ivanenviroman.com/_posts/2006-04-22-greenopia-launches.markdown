I've been holed away for the the last couple of weeks working on [Greenopia](http://www.greenopia.com) - the urban dweller's guide to green living. It's a site for looking up green businesses in your niehborhood, reading great articles on green living, and connecting with other like-minded people. The site is based on my new favorite web development platform, [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org). The business listings are for Los Angeles only now, but we are planning to expand to other cities soon.
